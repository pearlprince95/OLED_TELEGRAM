## Fonts

Fonts are defined in a proprietary but open format. You can create new font files by choosing from a given list
of open sourced Fonts from this web app: http://oleddisplay.squix.ch
Choose the font family, style and size, check the preview image and if you like what you see click the "Create" button. This will create the font array in a text area form where you can copy and paste it into a new or existing header file.
